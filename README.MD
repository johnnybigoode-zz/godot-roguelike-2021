Now we're gonna do some project customization within Godot. Starting with a custom folder step and moving initial resources to the respective folder.
Let's create the MainScene, 
And set project's settings, including things I don't need, like Low Processor Mode
Icon was added as a sprite, which wasn't mentioned in the tutorial.
Add export settings, installing some extra features, now we can create a 26mg exe file that does nothing!

First add font and tilemap. 
Then create the proper node for it.
